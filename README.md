TODO List are the lists that we generally use to maintain our day to day tasks or list 
of everything that we have to do, with the most important tasks at the top of the list, 
and the least important tasks at the bottom. It is helpful in planning our daily 
schedules. We can add more tasks any time and delete a task which is completed. 
The four major tasks that we can perform in a TODO list are:

1. Add tasks

2. Update tasks

3. Read tasks

4. Delete tasks

We are going to implement a simple python to-do list in which we can add a task 
and delete it when itâ€™s done. We will be using a Python package called Tkinter 
which is a widely used Python GUI library. It is shipped with python, so we do not 
have to download or install it separately, we can just import and start with it.

A GUI is basically a medium to interact and present information to the users. One 
of the major advantages of using Tkinter is that it works well on any machine be it 
windows, linux, or macOS.
